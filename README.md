## Prerequisites for understanding the project

## (Various considerations in project)
**THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF LOANS , BUSINESS LOANS AND PERSONAL LOANS**
- **For giving each loan there are various input parameters to be considered for the loan to be approved and they are given as follows**
## 1.1) Business Loans Considerations
The parameters for giving business loans are very different from personal loans. The parameters considered include:
- Income tax returns :
- Audited balance sheets:
  - [Audited Sheet example pdf](https://www.moneycontrol.com/financials/tatamotors/balance-sheetVI/TM03)
  - [Audited Sheet inputs/parameters considered](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1voKSi_i6FulvfVyE1tcm8e6QSYBsdD8b/view?usp=sharing)

### 1.2) Personal Loans(NON BUSINESS LOANS) Considerations
The parameters considered for personal loans are detailed in the following PDF:
- [Personal loan CIBIL score form for input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y1H42ZYHDpVyRy0YMS66Z_2i_ig3XX-0/view)

### 2.) Email and application forms Classification and Categorization(Enhancing customer connect):
- Here the inputs are similar to those given in diagram, operational emails,complaints, application forms etc
- Scalable Machine learning models categorizes and classify banking applications forms and  emails which are sent to respective departments so that customers are prioritized and their queries are always resolved.

### 3.) Analytics and repetitive calculations 
- here the inputs are mostly queries from bankers:
- Using Generative AI and various mathematical methods we are ensuring that analytics and calculations are automated and done with utmost ease.


## Methodology

### Overview
The Walter White dashboard integrates various Azure services and machine learning models to automate and streamline banking operations. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how each component functions:

![overview](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/555d1f70-9930-4821-a9f6-1ebe5da2b9e6)


## Detailed Workflow


## For removing any confusion before we start :

 1) Inputs can be through ocr , csvs and pdfs and even keyboard inputs for making it easy for customers to access the dashboard (Customer is king as they always say )
    (Finally everything would be converted to excel sheets ,whether its ocr scanned inputs or pdf inputs or even keyboard ones so that its stored appropriately in blob storage)
 2) Azure Blob storage is for storing documents.(We also access this later on for doing various analytics)
 3) Azure sql database is for storing structured information from documents and inputs.(We mostly keep these value seperate as we want to do different operations on them than blob storage ones)

### 1. Data Input and Preprocessing
 

**A)OCR using Azure Form Recognizer:**
- **Azure Form Recognizer:** Extracts structured data from scanned documents(Audited balance sheet pdfs,tax returns pdfs, cibil score pdfs) and forms.
- **Azure Functions:** Processes the extracted data and stores it in the database (blob storage)
 

**B)Direct Keyboard Inputs:**
- **Web Interface:** Provides forms for users to input data manually.
- **Azure Functions:** Handles form submissions and updates the database accordingly.
- sample forms have been provided in 

 **1.2)Excel Sheets:**
-  Everything (A,B inputs) wil be converted in Excel format will be stored on **Azure Blob Storage:**.
-  **Reference 1.2: On how it will be form data will be converted from azure forms to excel:** [ Azure Form Recognizer](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/extracting-form-data-to-json-excel-pandas-with-azure-form-recognizer-160488a2d11e)
- **Azure Functions:**  is triggered when a new file is uploaded to Blob Storage.
- **Action: taken:** Read the Excel file, preprocess the data, and convert it to SQL database tables.
- **Reference 1.2: On how excel files will be processed into sql for analysis** [Building an Azure Function to Process Excel Files](https://medium.com/@ynskrn54/building-an-azure-function-to-process-excel-files-from-blob-storage-and-store-data-in-azure-sql-312947e21674)

### 2). Business Loans thresholds:

 **For approval of business loans we are checking 3 thresholds as follows**
### 2.1 Financial Ratio Calculation
- **Azure SQL Database:** Performs key financial ratio calculations (e.g., current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio) using SQL queries.**(Gen ai for banking calculations is not reliable but we could do repititive  formulations using ai  and store in sql)**
- **Reference: on which ratios will be calculated and considered** [Credit Analysis Ratios](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/credit-analysis-ratio/)
  
### 2.2. External Data Integration For Company Reputation Check
- **Azure Logic Apps:** Automates fetching of news articles related to businesses using a News API.
- gitlink[backend]()
- **Azure Cognitive Services:**  Analyze news sentiment and searches for pending legal cases on companies.
- **Final output will be given, we do sentiment analysis on it and give weights to the sentiments and calculate a score.**
  - **Reference: on how sentiment analysis is done** [Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines](https://medium.com/@ramitsharma1994.rs/sentiment-analysis-of-news-headlines-with-microsoft-azure-cognitive-services-be3dedf3ccec)

### 2.3. Auditing Agency Verification: (Check the reliability of the agency who audited the data)
- **Verification Process:** Ensures that all financial and external data meet required standards and also if the auditing agencies are proper or not who audited all this financial data.
- **Reference for why its necessary??:** [Satyam Scam Overview](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/satyam-scam)

  
### 3.Business Loan Approval Process Model 
- **Verification:** Checking is done  if all 2.1)Financial Ratios, 2.2)Company Reputation Check Through External Data, and 2.3)Audit Agency  Verifications, scores meet thresholds as you can see above for 
                    detailed explanation
- **Azure Functions:** Logic is implemented for threshold checks and validation.
- **Approval:** Final loan approval is given if all checks are satisfactory (input pdfs to input data is verified and final loan is approved).

### 4. Customer (Non-Businesses) Credit Score Calculation
- **Azure Machine Learning:** Will use an improved ML model to calculate credit scores for non-business customers.
- **Data Source**: Here the data source will be from 1.2 where we will take input cibil score forms/pdfs and ocr based inputs aswell as keyboard inputs which are stored in blob storage in csv format

### 5. Email Classification of customer queries and Response from banking side
- **Azure Cognitive Services and Azure ML:** Classifies incoming emails based on content and keywords.
- **Azure Functions:** Generates and sends automated responses from bank side using Generative AI which are context aware responses.
 - **Integration with Step 1:** As part of the data preprocessing, incoming emails are processed and categorized.
 - **Integration with Step 6:** Automated responses and communications during the loan approval process and other customer interactions through banking side.
 - **Reference on how auto responding context aware emails work:[medium link]**[Python Gmail Auto Responder using Open AI](https://medium.com/@mehmetcan.oralalp/python-gmail-auto-responder-using-chatgpt-7f3a0fe4651c)
  

### 6. Lang-Chain and Azure Gen AI for Database Retrieval and analytics
- **Azure Functions:** Uses Lang-Chain and Azure AI for efficient database retrieval and analytics based on predefined prompts.(This runs pandas and sql scripts so that access to csv and database can be achieved through generative ai)
- User would just ask the bot which dataset they want to do analysis on and would retrieve it from blob storage(seperate storage for documents/pdfs in blob storage and info in csv helps for this purpose)
- **Reference on how ai generated sql database retrieval work:[medium]** [Chat with MySQL using Python and LangChain](https://alejandro-ao.com/chat-with-mysql-using-python-and-langchain/)
  

## 7) Centralized Dashboard
- **Overview:** A centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing the entire process, providing a unified interface for data access and control.
  - All the processed information, including department-wise email classification, financial ratios, company reputation, agency/audit check, business loan status, and personal loan status, is integrated into a 
  centralized dashboard.
  - This dashboard provides a comprehensive view for decision-makers to approve loans, respond to emails, and perform other critical operations efficiently.
  
- **Question/Query on Data:**
  Users (bankers) can query or pose questions about data through the centralized dashboard, making the decision-making process more interactive and data-driven.

- **Data Chat Gen AI (Data Analytics):**
   Data analytics is facilitated through AI using langchain and pandas agents to provide insights and trends through a humanised chat bot method.

- ## Description:
- We tried to make the login process for customers as easy as possible through otp but didnt compromise on security, which you will see as follows:


## PREVIOUS VERSION OF FRONTEND below
## Customer side:
## Desc of below image:
- As you can see in image, customers just have to attach their financial documents and azure ocr will do the work for them of filling the forms aswell as form recognition .
- This really improves engagement of users and makes the financial process less stressful.


## Description of below image:
- This is the centralized dashboard for the customer side where they can track their applications and whether they these applications approved or not.
-  Here you could see attachments necessary for businesses / customers which are all stored in bank database with automated calculations(specially balance sheets) 
    ensuring that customers dont have to deal with these.




## Banker Side:
## Description:
- We can see how applications are categorised using ML model and  even a loan approval score is calculated so that they these applications can be approved or declined.
- Even mails could be sent as shown below to customers through the dashboard itself to user on the basis of risk,
  like much more interest rate for risky users or rejection mails etc
  

## Description:
- Here we could see categorization of incoming emails, which could be handled by respective departments and queries could be solved immediately boosting customer confidence.

#### Description:
- This is one of our more innovative way of using generative ai where you could query the  database in natural language and get access to **read only** information
- Here you could also do analytics of the attached document or retrieved documents using pandas agent and azure gen ai whose basic implementation is provided in 
  this repo.

## Security Considerations

Security is a critical component of the Walter White Dashboard. We are leveraging several security measures and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our system. Below are the key security considerations implemented in our project:

### 1) Authentication and Authorization

- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)**: We use MSAL for secure user authentication and authorization. This allows users to authenticate using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
  - [Authentication with Azure AD and React[Medium]](https://adrianhynes.medium.com/authentication-with-azure-ad-and-react-ced9a829e083)
  - [Secure Your React.js Web Application with Azure AD Authentication Using MSAL Library [Medium]](https://medium.com/@isuruariyarathna2k00/secure-your-react-js-web-application-with-azure-ad-authentication-using-masl-library-7f578c65f209)

### 2) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: We implement MFA to add an extra layer of security. Options include:
  - **Email OTP**: Sending a one-time password to the user's registered email address.
  - **Microsoft Authenticator App**: Using the app for code generation, which must be entered along with the password.
  - [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication[Medium]](https://medium.com/@kwtrelbakouri1/azure-multi-factor-authentication-cff5b7d958b6)
  - [Azure Multi-Factor Authenticationn[Azure]1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)
  - Image source[Azure docs]: **The goal is to protect your organization while also providing the right levels of access to the users who need it.**
  - ![mfa](https://github.com/ANUJT65/bob_hackathon/assets/123918593/515e7fe0-73e2-4bb4-aff0-94290e1448d4)
  


### 3) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different roles have different levels of access:
  - **Bank Manager**: Full access to all emails, chat records, and loan applications.
  - **Employees**: Limited access to view emails assigned to them and approve/decline loan applications without editing access to the entire database.
  - **Customers**: Access only to their own emails and loan applications.
  - [Azure Role-Based Access Contro[Medium more detailed]](https://medium.com/@kenny_Cloud_Architect/lets-talk-about-azure-ad-rbac-2070182e3424)
  -  [Azure Role-Based Access Contro[Azure]l](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
    

### 4) Data Security

- **Azure SQL Database**: Storing data securely using Azure SQL Database with encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Securely storing documents and forms in Azure Blob Storage.

### 5) Secure Data Transfer

- **HTTPS**: All data exchanges between the client and server are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6) Auditing and Monitoring

- **Audit Logs**: Implementing detailed audit logs to monitor access and changes to sensitive information. This helps in tracking and identifying any unauthorized access or modifications.
- **Azure Security Center**: Using Azure Security Center to continuously monitor and improve the security posture of our resources.

### 7) Verification of Auditing Agencies

- **Auditing Agency Verification**: Ensuring that balance sheets and financial documents are verified by reputable auditing agencies. This prevents fraud and enhances the trustworthiness of submitted documents.

By implementing these comprehensive security measures, we ensure that our system is robust against various security threats and complies with industry standards for data protection and privacy.

## Ease Of Deployment and maintainence

###  How Docker Helps Our Project Run Smoothly

- **Containerization and Isolation:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Docker packages our project with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently everywhere.
  - **Isolation:** Each container operates independently, preventing conflicts with the bank’s existing systems.

- **No Interference with Existing Systems:**
  - **Independent Execution:** Containers are lightweight and don’t interfere with other applications on the same system.

- **Easy Integration:**
  - **API and Microservices:** Our project can interact with the bank’s systems through APIs, making integration smooth and secure. It also integrates seamlessly with Azure Functions.
  - **Networking:** Docker allows containers to communicate securely with each other and with external systems.

- **Easy Maintenance:**
  - **Consistent Environments:** Docker ensures our project runs the same way in development, testing, and production, reducing environment-specific issues.
  - **Simplified Updates:** We can update or roll back our project without affecting the bank’s critical systems.
  - **Isolated Troubleshooting:** Problems can be fixed within a container without impacting others, making maintenance simpler and faster.

 ## Closing Remarks

Thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to show our idea. We have tried to show as much implementation and documentation as we can, and we really hope you like our idea.

We would love to work with Bank Of Baroda and Microsoft on this project and would greatly appreciate any feedback from the judges!
