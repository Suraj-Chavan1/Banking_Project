# Methodology for Evaluating the Reputation of an Auditing Agency

## Data Ingestion

1. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather information from multiple sources such as:
     - Professional organization databases (e.g., IIA, ACCA).
     - Financial information platforms (e.g., Dun & Bradstreet, Bloomberg).
     - Review sites (e.g., Glassdoor, Google Reviews, Yelp).
     - Regulatory databases (e.g., SEC, court records).

## Preprocessing

2. **Clean and Normalize Data:**
   - Process the collected data to remove inconsistencies and duplicates.
   - Convert unstructured data (e.g., text from reviews) into structured formats where possible (e.g., tabular data).

## Indexing

3. **Index Data:**
   - Use a cognitive search tool such as Azure Cognitive Search or Elasticsearch to create an index of the data.
   - Ensure the index supports natural language processing (NLP) features for better search capabilities.

## Query and Analysis

4. **Generate Insights with AI:**
   - Implement a Generative AI model to analyze the indexed data.
   - Use the AI to generate insights by understanding the context and relationships within the data.
   - Perform sentiment analysis on the data to identify positive and negative sentiments in client reviews, financial reports, and other relevant documents.
   - Calculate a reputation score based on the sentiment analysis results:
     - Assign positive and negative weights to different sentiment categories.
     - Aggregate the weighted sentiments to produce an overall score.
